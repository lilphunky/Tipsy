The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I ran into an error right after writing the first bit of code. The tap gesture recognizer would throw an error, and I found out that it's because my function signature was written incorrectly. I tried to follow the code in the walkthrough exactly as it was shown, but I realized that the video was probably using an older version of Swift, so the exact code wouldn't work for me.
